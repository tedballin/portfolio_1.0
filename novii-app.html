                            find certified trainers, for training with flexible schedule and in remote locations.

                        <p>After my user research and looking through fitness apps on market, a major yet not immediately
                            obvious issue I found is that people can rarely achieve their fitness goals (strength training
                            and bodybuilding) by using apps. Because such workout is physically demanding, it is hard for
                            users to exercise correctly by reading text instructions and images. Most apps cannot keep track
                            complex training activities without users manually type in information. The problems involved
                            in both learning process and progress tracking.

                        <p>My main responsibilities of this project are ideation, user research, user interface and experience
                            design, and usability testing. The project initially started from the mechanical side which a hardware
                            will be installed on gym machines and will keep tracking users’ training activities. After usability
                            testing, I found that in addition to reviewing the training process, most of exercisers also expect
                            to have professional guidance from certified trainers, but the training cost and fast-paced lifestyle
                            are the major obstacles. I decided to integrate a trainer-trainee matching feature in the future
                            in order to provide a more immersive experience and help users to achieve their goals.

                        <p> Based on the feedback, as well as the pain points and design opportunities identified in the user
                            journey, I redesigned the Novii App that can help the exerciser to find the right trainer based
                            on the trainer's speciality, training rate, location, and ranking etc. The trainer and trainee
                            can choose the training location and time that best suit their lifestyle and schedule.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p> With the hardware component installed on gym machines, it reinforces the trainee to complete the
                            training tasks, and both the trainer and trainee can keep tracking the training progress (data collected
                            by the hardware) on the mobile application. For this iteration, I sketched wireframes and created
                            30+ of interactive high-fidelity mockups using Adobe Illustrator and Experience Design.

                        <p>The team and I are very passionate about the project, as we believe the product could have real impact
                            and enhance people’s training experience. Through this iteration process, I learned that how
                            much it could transform and evolve from the original idea. As we are aiming to build Novii as a commercial product,
                            the feedback from our peers, colleagues and friends are crucial for us to rethink its purpose
                            and to integrate new features.</p>
                        <p> In terms of user interface design, there are still some problems and challenges. The trainer list
                            currently has too much information, it looks crowded and the small buttons can be hard for users
                            to tab. Creating training plans for clients requires a lot of typing from trainer which can be
                            a daunting process. In the future, I would reduce the information shown in trainer’s list, and
                            implement dropdowns and sliders for simplifying the process of creating training plans.
