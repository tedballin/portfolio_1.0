                            on 90% of gym machines for tracking exercise activities, and a mobile platform for trainees to
                            find certified trainers, train with flexible schedule and in remote locations.

                        <p>My main responsibilities of this project are ideation, user research, user interface and experience
                            design, and usability testing. The project first started from the mechanical side which a hardware
                            will be installed on gym machines and will keep track users’ training activities. After user
                            research (both qualitative and quantitative), I found that in addition to reviewing the training
                            process, most exercisers prefer to have professional guidance from certified trainers, but the
                            training cost and fast-paced lifestyle can be the obstacles in achieving their fitness goals.
                            then we questioned ourselves: can we make a mobile app that works with the hardware, addresses
                            these issues and provides a richer experience to the users?

                    <div class="col-sm-8 project-section">
                        <h4 class="subtitle">Process</h4>
                        <p> During the design process, I first created the user journey in order to lay out the activities involved
                            in before, during, and after training, as well as pain points and design opportunities. Based
                            on the findings, I designed the Novii App that can help the exerciser to find the right trainer
                            based on the trainer's speciality, training rate, location, and ranking etc. The trainer and
                            trainee can choose the training location and time that best suit their lifestyle and schedule.</p>
                        <p> With the hardware component installed on gym machines, it reinforces the trainee to complete the
                            training tasks, and both the trainer and trainee can keep track the training progress (data collected
                            by the hardware) on the mobile application. For this iteration, I sketched wireframes and created
                            30+ of interactive high-fidelity mockups using Adobe Illustrator and Experience Design.

                        <h4 class="subtitle">Reflection</h4>
                        <p>The team and I are very passionate about the project, as we believe the product could have real impact
                            and enhance people’s training experience. Through this iteration process, I learned that how
                            the original idea could transform and grow. As we are aiming to build Novii as a commercial product,
                            there’re so many aspects that I have to consider and discuss with my team, the feedback from
                            our peers, colleagues and friends are also crucial to us. For example, the original purpose of
                            the app is to give user a visual representation of the training progres tracked by the hardware,
                            then I questioned myself are these enough to make our product stands out in the market? After
                            my user research and looking through other fitness apps, I found that people can rarely achieve
                            their fitness goals by only using the apps. Because personal training is physical, getting professional
                            guidance offline is necessary, then I decided to integrating the trainer-trainee matching feature
                            into the app. </p>
                        <p> In terms of user interface design, there are still some problems and challenges. The trainer list
                            currently has too much information, it looks crowded and the small buttons can be hard for users
                            to tab. Creating training plans for clients requires a lot of typing from trainer which can be
                            a daunting process. In the future, I would reduce the information shown in trainer’s list, and
                            implement dropdowns and sliders for simplifying the process of creating training plans.
