                        <p>DList is a web application that helps users search for physicians and save the physicians they are
                            seeing or want to see to a personal list under “myphysicians” page. Both registered and non-register
                            users can search for physicians with the specializations and criteria they need. Registered users
                            will be able to save any physicians to their personal lists; they also can modify their lists,
                            give ratings and add comments to physicians.

                        <p>It is hard to find family doctors nowadays, sometimes people simply don't have the recourses to find family
                            doctors and they don't know doctors' availability to take new patients. For people who need special medical care,
                            they often don't have enough information about the specialists they are going to see (in terms
                            of professional knowledge or helpfulness etc). It is hard to find a "right" doctor.

                        <h4 class="subtitle">Website Design:</h4>
                        <p>I first started by designing the structure and navigation model of the website. As the sitemap shown
                            below, each page is coordinated with different functionalities. The website is designed for both
                            visitors and registered members: both non-register and registered users can browse and search
                            for physicians with filter options. Search criteria include location, gender, and availability
                            to take new patients etc. In order to ensure the credibility of the content, only registered
                            users are allowed to give ratings and comments to physicians. In addition, the members can generate
                            and manage their "myphysicians" lists with personal notes.
                        </p>

                        <p> We imported data from CPSBC that is relevant to the information about physicians, such as their name,
                            specialty, address, and contact number etc. I created the ER diagram that shows different entities,
                            properties, and relationships. We used it as the blueprint when creating data tables in phpMyAdmin.</p>

                        <p> I built the most part of this website, and I applied techniques (PHP, MySql, AJAX) learned from the
                            course to power the backend of DList. For the login and registration system, I used cookies and
                            sessions to store and carry user information between pages. For the search function, I used user
                            inputs to perform dynamic queries and get the result from MySql database. I also created the
                            ratings and commenting system using PHP and JavaScript, and when users submit their feedback,
                            the call will be realized by AJAX without reloading the whole page.

                        <p>DList was an interesting project. Through the development process, I had a better understanding of
                            the server-client relationship and request-response. I was able to apply conceptual knowledge
                            by programming the website using PHP, AJAX, and MySql database. In the future, I would like to add
                            a recommendation feature that suggests physicians in the user's area and optimize my code for
                            better readability and efficiency.
