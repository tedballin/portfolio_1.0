                        <p>F&H Recipes is a convenient food recipes application designed for students and young professionals.
                            The app enables users to store home-made food recipes and get diverse online recipes based on
                            preparation time and preferences, so they can enjoy healthy meals while living in a fast-paced
                            environment.

                        <h4 class="subtitle">Strategy</h4>
                        <p>Based on the technical skills I have learned, I brainstormed on the application and on its purpose.
                            The application has to benefit its users with major functionalities implemented within one month;
                            keeping that in mind, I made a project document to list out its basic and standard functionalities
                            that I think which are achievable, and a structure of the application showing all the activities/interfaces.
                            I designed the time frame options that allows users to select different recipes from different
                            time frames (e.g. under 5 mins), this feature enables users to make a quick and healthy meal
                            according to their schedules.

                        <h4 class="subtitle">Development Process</h4>
                        <p> In terms of development, I used both implicit and explicit intents for switching between internal
                            activities and external activities, preferences and SQLite as database for storing user information
                            and recipes. I used webview for user to view and search recipe on external website. The application
                            allows the user to add new recipes and save to the local database. The hardware of device like
                            camera, sensor, and sound are used for taking pictures and sending notification to the user.

                        <h4 class="subtitle">Reflection</h4>
                        <p>This was an exciting project as it’s my first mobile application. I was able to use the knowledge
                            that I learned from the course, searched for solutions and solved problems I encounter during
                            the process. My main struggle with this application was converting the image file and retrieving
                            it later in the added recipe. Because I spent quite much time on this part, I couldn’t complete
                            the user profile and FAQ feature.</p>
                        <p> I learned that I should have asked for help and moved on to other tasks to improve my efficiency.
                            The current user interface of this application is functional, but I would like to refine the
                            UI if I had more time. As an individual project, I had to set the scope of project, completed
                            individual tasks for each week, and tested the final application. I really enjoyed the development
                            process.
