                        <p>This data visualization project is designed to help explain the composition of ICBC claims costs
                            in terms of collision frequency and types in Lower Mainland. Our interest in this topic is
                            to further discover how property damage only (PDO) and casualty collisions contribute to the
                            huge claims incurred operating costs that lead to ICBC's financial burden. The final visualizations
                            could be used as a reference for future decision making for government officials and ICBC staff
                            members.

                        <p>Knowing the limited time and data resources we have, we narrowed the scope of the project and focused
                            on the claims incurred costs. By asking problem questions such as: Is ICBC paying more for PDO
                            or for injury claim? Do car crashes in each city have its own pattern depends on collision types?
                            We searched categorical, ordinal, and quantitative data in order to generate visualizations that
                            might help domain experts to solve the financial crisis.

                        <p>One of the biggest challenges was data cleaning. Since we need the data of collision types, accident
                            count, collision locations and operating costs, ICBC became our major data resource. In the Lower Mainland crashes dataset, we removed the unused dimensions and filtered key information by programming.
                            For information like operating costs, ICBC does not offer open dataset; we had to look through
                            its financial report and manually create the dataset in the .csv file.

                        <p> I was mainly responsible for designing and implementing visualizations using JavaScript and D3.js
                            library. For the key visualizations, I used a choropleth map to provide an overview of the collision
                            frequency in Lower Mainland area, and also it allows the audiences to hover over the cities
                            and look into the details. The categorical data and cities are showed on the map along with the
                            quantitative crash count data.</p>

                        <p> I also created hexbin map to provide more detailed information on car accidents in each city combine
                            such as accident distributions (street, latitude and longitude) and collision types by hovering
                            over each spot. The two crash types as categorical attributes are differentiated by color hue
                            in small pie charts.

                        <p> In addition to the interaction with individual visualizations. I also created coordinated interaction
                            between visualizations that allow the users to interpret and explore more as needed. The bar
                            chart encodes two attributes using a line mark with the vertical spatial position channel for
                            the quantitative attribute, the claim incurred costs and the horizontal spatial position channel
                            for the categorical attribute, major cities in Lower Mainland. The hexbin map will update accordingly
                            when users filter the cities and collision types in the bar chart by clicking on each bar, so
                            as to see the dominant type of car accidents reported in each city.

                        <p>ICBC visual analytics was a challenging project. In order to create the ideal visualizations, I searched
                            and took inspirations from some of Mike Bostock's examples. It was quite challenging as I am
                            still new to the D3 library and some changes of syntax between the old and new versions. I would
                            like to implement the coordinated interaction between the historical trends of accidents and
                            choropleth map in the future.</p>
                        <p> This project really allowed me to put together different types of skills and learn a lot during the
                            process. Through the project, I learned the intricacies of managing, working with data and transforming
                            it into useful and readable information.
