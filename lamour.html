                            another design student from Emily Carr University. All we knew was the studio was looking to
                            update their website, and we have two weeks to design and develop an website, and if we get selected,
                            we would continue work on the website and get compensate.</p>

                        <p>We first looked into the existing website and concluded that the main purposes of the website is
                            for displaying the weddings and events the studio has planned and designed in the past, and allowing
                            the potential customers contact the studio in a direct manner. Considering the wedding and event
                            planning has to be visually appealing, my partner and I decided that we need to use lots of visual
                            elements such as videos and images to show off the work the studio has done.</p>

                        <p> In terms of visual design, my partner hand drawn a new logo, and I selected the font and color of
                            the website; I was also responsible for the web design and development: in order maximize viewers’
                            visual experience, I used side navigation which only shows when the cursor is hover on top. I
                            created the carousel effect with JavaScript so that the viewers can see series of images of a
                            wedding case or event and lead them to click and view the details. On the home page, the contact
                            form allows the viewers to send their message, so the studio can respond to customers’ request
                            through their prefered way of communication.

                                <p>Lamour Wedding was my very first freelance web design and development project, although our proposal
                                        did not get selected by the client, the experience was extremely valuable. In a short period
                                        of time, we researched and analyzed what are the important elements of this website, and how
                                        to utilize the website to lead to potential business. By working with a design student from different
                                        program at different school, I was able to adapt and learned how to work with people who have
                                        different knowledge background and mindset. I also learned some design tips from her during the
                                        process.
