                        <p>After the first meeting with the client (Breakfast Club of Canada), we knew the
                            application is more than a simple combination of recipe and meal planning tools. We
                            started our foundational research in order to understand the landscape of the project
                            and uncover insights into the users' behaviours, needs, and goals. By
                            conducting user interviews with Breakfast Club staff, both urban and rural school
                            staff (teachers facilitating the breakfast program), and executives of Langley School
                            District Foundation (partner of Breakfast Club of Canada), we learned the interviewees’
                            daily
                            work routines, challenges encountered, technology usage, and context of use.

                        <p>By conducting the these user interviews, we defined several issues:
                            School coordinators often create weekly menu, track inventory and make
                            orders for ingredients without using any technical tools, these type of mental work are
                            difficult for students and
                            volunteers as they are unable to keep track of all the details and help to ease the
                            workload; school coordinators are
                            also seeking some flexibility in terms of food ingredients as local supplies might vary.
                            Executives of local school district foundation mentioned the difficulty of maintaining
                            breakfast variety which ultimately related to funding. The staff at BCC concerned that
                            whether schools follow the recommended ingredient list and make nutritious breakfast for
                            students.

                        <h4 class="subtitle">Strategy: </h4>
                        <p>We used several UX methods such as user story mapping, persona, and user journey in
                            order to explore the pain points, synthesize findings, and come up with some ideas. We
                            envisioned an all-in-one platform is needed to help users to plan and prepare breakfast
                            meals by browsing and adding recipes, track current inventory and expense, and order
                            ingredients for future meals.</p>

                        <p>We mapped out user stories for both school and BCC staff, the goals were to
                            understand the overall flow, find out obstacles they are experiencing, and identify pain
                            points or design opportunities. We focused our efforts on understanding the phases of
                            the plan, order, and coordinate. The application or solution should be convenience and
                            resourceful that helps to offload extensive information for different users.

                        <p> With the basic understandings of the project and our target audience‘s needs, I
                            sketched dozens of wireframes for both desktop and mobile views in order to visualize
                            and validate our ideas quickly. After an initial discussion with my partner in the
                            team, I reiterated the sketches and created digital wireframes in Figma. In addition to
                            wireframes, I also built a sitemap and shared them with our developers. Based on the
                            wireframes and sitemap, the team discussed key features, app flow for the public,
                            school, and BCC users, initial database design, as well as technical feasibilities and
                            options.

                            recommended by BCC or custom recipes; menu feature that allows users to add
                            selected recipes and generate weekly menu, pantry feature that helps to track food
                            inventory; order feature that enables user to order ingredients based on future weekly
                            menu and current inventory.

                        <h4 class="subtitle">Challenges</h4>
                        <p> Designing the mobile view was one of the biggest challenges I encountered. Because of
                            the features needed and multi-level of administrations involved, the user interface of the
                            application is relatively complex, and that is also the reason we decided to build a web
                            instead of a mobile application. At the same time, we need to focus on mobile
                            responsive design to fit the usage context of the target audience, since users might use
                            it in the kitchen or food storage room. I used mobile-first approach to prioritize most
                            essential and frequently used features since the screen real estate on the mobile device
                            is so limited. During the design process, the borderline between mobile app interface
                            and mobile site interface got blurred, it seems natural for us to follow design
                            conventions that commonly used in mobile apps, but these design conventions do not
                            always apply to the mobile site. For example, turning the control panel into tab bar at the
                            bottom causes visual inconsistency between mobile and desktop view, and users who
                            resizing the browser window on a mobile device (tablet) might find the transition is not
                            intuitive. Instead, I used tab bar for major features at the top as well as utility
                            features like print, bookmark, and share.

                            different stakeholders. Currently, our project is on hold due to other factors such as
                            technical capabilities and maintenance concerns on the client’s side, but I am confident
                            to iterate under different circumstances and deliver a convenience and resourceful tool
